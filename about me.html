        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Well, as you know my name is <strong>Mizan Qistina</strong>. I'm already 20 years old this year. And I'm the second child out of three but also I am the only girl in this family beside my mother of course. I was born and raised in a small town surrounded by nature. I live at Penang and at that time there is more green and blue then buildings. Growing up, I developed a passion for music. But, only as a listener. This interest have shaped my educational journey and personal growth. It is in fact work in a way that i could not really explain.</p> 


<br>

        <h2>My Personality</h2>
        <p>I'm often being described as someone that not freindly because of my rest face but my close freinds described me as the mother of the group because of my caring nature. My parents says, sometimes I'm too imaginative, but there is nothing wrong with it. It is just who I am. Also, I really love finding new types of music, especially those that allow me to make a deeper search on the lyrics and try to understand it in my own ways. Whether it's about unrequited love or moving on from the past. As long as it is a good music, I would try listen to it.</p>


<br>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My short-term goal is to excel in my academic studies, especially to get a promising job after graduating. Long-term, I aim to become at least a succesful person either in this world or the afterlife.</p>

<br>

        <h2>Dream</h2>
        <p>To be honest, my biggest dream is simple, I just wanted to be happy and become someone that not rich but also not short of money. And when the time reach, I wanted to get married with someone that love me as much as I did. I just want to build a healty relationship with my family.</p>
